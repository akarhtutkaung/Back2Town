# Back2Town

CSCI 5611 Project 1

@Author: Akar (Ace) Kaung

## Prerequisite
Software: Unity

## Summary
This gameplay implements the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm to find the path for the agents to move toward their goals. 
The goal of the agents will be determined randomly toward any of the existing building IDs inside the landscape.
Once the agent arrived at its destination, it will choose a new goal randomly again to always keep moving.
User will be able to observe the environment freely, meaning it will be able to pass and go inside the buidlings instead of colliding with it.
